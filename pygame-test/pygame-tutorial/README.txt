Developed for the Intro to Game Programming tutorial at US PyCon 2012,
revised for PyCon APAC 2012, 2013 and 2014.

Video of the tutorial (from the US PyCon 2013 - 2014 video coming soon) is at
http://pyvideo.org/video/1718/introduction-to-pygame

The slide deck (with my speaking notes) is in slides.pdf

The source files starting with numbers are steps along the development of
the platformer.py game. A cocos2d implementation of the platformer is in
platformer-cocos.py with a slightly juiced-up version in
platformer-cocos-juice.py

The other game skeletons are driving.py, minesweeper.py, side_scroller.py
and tower_defence.py (the last is a cocos2d game.)

The game in match3/main.py is an Android game runnable under pgs4a.

There is also some examples of pylepton in action in effects.py
